# Gems & Holiday Package Prediction

This project is based on 2 cases studies : Gems Price Prediction and Holiday Package prediction. In the first case study, concepts of linear regression are tested and it is expected from the learner to predict the price of gems based on multiple variables to help company maximize profits. In the second case, concepts of logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis are tested. One has to predict if the customer will purchase the holiday package to target the relevant customer base.

## Skills and Tools

    - Linear Regression
    - Logistic Regression
    - Linear discriminant Analysis

## Problem 1 : Linear Regression

The comp-activ databases is a collection of a computer systems activity measures .
The data was collected from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712 with 128 Mbytes of memory running in a multi-user university department. Users would typically be doing a large variety of tasks ranging from accessing the internet, editing files or running very cpu-bound programs. 

As you are a budding data scientist you thought to find out a linear equation to build a model to predict 'usr'(Portion of time (%) that cpus run in user mode) and to find out how each attribute affects the system to be in 'usr' mode using a list of system attributes.

## Problem 2 : Logistic Regression, LDA and CART

You are a statistician at the Republic of Indonesia Ministry of Health and you are provided with a data of 1473 females collected from a Contraceptive Prevalence Survey. The samples are married women who were either not pregnant or do not know if they were at the time of the survey.

The problem is to predict do/don't they use a contraceptive method of choice based on their demographic and socio-economic characteristics.
